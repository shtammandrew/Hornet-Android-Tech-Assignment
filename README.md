# Hornet Android Technical Assigment

This assignment is intended to test your basic Android skills and proficiency, and should take around 90 minutes to complete. This code won't be used in production, and the assessment is not for a designer role, so don't feel the need to optimize prematurely, create the perfect app architecture, or the world's cleanest UI.

That being said, we do want to get a general idea of your approach to app development. Try to structure your code how you would in your day to day work, and use patterns you think are appropriate. Avoid unnecessarily impacting performance, and build a rough UI that you think somewhat resembles the layout of a final product.

No persistent storage or error handling of edge cases is required. No caching is required and you won't be penalized for loading the same data multiple times.

## Hornet Movies

We will be creating an app that shows basic information about movies, presenting them in an interactible list. We will do this by retrieving and displaying information provided by the MoviesService class. 

There are 3 requirements

### Task 1: Show the top movies

We want to display a list of the top rated movies. The list should only load the movies it can display, and should automatically load more moves as the user scrolls. We only want to see the top results, so the list should stop loading once movies with a _vote_average_ score lower than 7 are reached.

The movie list entries should clearly display the following information

- Title
- Overview
- Rating
- Movie Poster
- Movie Backdrop

Tapping on a movie's poster should show the poster enlarged, in the center of the screen, similar to a modal dialog. Tapping the poster again should close the modal.

### Task 2: Show movie details

We want to be able to view additional details about a movie. When the user taps on a movie in the list, the entry should expand to reveal the following information

- Production Company
- Director
- Actors

Tapping the same movie again should collapse the entry and return to the original display. It should be possible to expand multiple movie entries at the same time, and the entries should remain expanded even after scrolling away, until collapsed by the user.

### Task 3: Movie genres

We want to be able to view basic information about the genre of movies. At the bottom of the screen there should be a display that shows all the movie genres that are currently in the list, as well as how many movies in the list are in each genre. If there are no movies in a genre, the genre should not be shown. These numbers should update as more movies are loaded.

Tapping on a genre should highlight all movies in the list that match that genre. Only one genre should be selected at a time.

When asessing your submission, we will be running a release build variant, so make sure that everything works as expected under those conditions!

Thank you so much for showing an interest in Hornet, and good luck!
